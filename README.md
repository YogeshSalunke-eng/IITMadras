## 📖 About the Project
Unlike a standard clone, this project is my own creative take on what a modern university portal could look like. I focused on improving user flow, accessibility, and visual hierarchy.

### Key Focus Areas:
* **Custom UI:** Designed a unique color palette and typography distinct from the official site.
* **Component Architecture:** Every section (Nav, Hero, News) is a standalone React component.
* **Responsive Layout:** Hand-coded CSS/Tailwind to ensure a seamless experience on all devices.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Frontend:** React.js (Vite)
* **Styling:** [Add your styling, e.g., Tailwind CSS / CSS Modules]
* **State:** React Hooks (useState, useEffect)
* **Icons:** [e.g., Lucide React / FontAwesome]
